# Pesonal Homepage with useful tools inside

1. Link List
   Collection of useful links I need when either working or for my personal use. Allows creating multiple lists of links. Links have configurable icons, open in new tabs and can be assigned tags. They can also be seached by URL, title, semantics, tags, etc.
2. Ticket Viewer
   All my JIRA tickets which have been assigned to me. To make this work without any API of some sorts, we need to run a custom browser extension to crawl my JIRA dashboard and fetch all the tickets. Based on whats shown on the dashboard, that information can be displayed.
